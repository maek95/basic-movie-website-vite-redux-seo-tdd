# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

----- Planning --------

Started with creating the overall structure of the project and installed packages. No "coding" yet.
Installed packages like e.g. redux, react-router-dom, tailwindcss.
Created routes folder that will contain all pages, HomePage.jsx, MoviePage.jsx...
Define the <Route> of each page in App.jsx
Created a folder for redux, along with store.jsx and slices

Acquired API-key from TDMB
Test fetch on HomePage!

I will first try to set up a fetch function for Top Rated and Popular Movies!
